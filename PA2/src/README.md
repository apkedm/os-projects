## Building
Build the LKM by running:

```
Build the test program with:
```
gcc test.c -o test
```

## Testing

### Insert LKM

In the directory of ``simple_char_driver.ko``, run the following command:
```sh
sudo insmod simple_char_driver.ko
```
Use ``lsmod`` to check if it was inserted correctly.

### Create Device File

run the following line of code
``` sh
sudo mknod â€“m 777 /dev/simple_character_device c 240 0
```

Check using ``ls /dev`` to see if it was created.

### Run the Test code

```
Follow the prompts and enter e to exit the test.
