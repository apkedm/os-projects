# Algorithms
This is a collection of helpful algorithms to run to answer questions on exams and quizzes.

## LRU and OPT
These two paging algorithms we learned in class.
Just compile with gcc and run.
Fill in the appropriate prompts and when asked for the sequence enter numbers separated by spaces.
You should now see a sequence going down for each time step of the frame buffer.

A ``-1`` means empty.

## SSTF
The SSTF disk algorithm.  To change the sequence edit the ``.m`` file and run with MATLAB or Octave.
